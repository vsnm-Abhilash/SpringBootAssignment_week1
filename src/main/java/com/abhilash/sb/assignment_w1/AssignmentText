Alice and her Bakery
    • Create a class called CakeBaker, that is dependent on two other
    classes called Frosting and Syrup. This class has a function
    called bakeCake().
    • Create two interfaces of type Frosting and Syrup with a
    function called getFrostingType and getSyrupType respectively.
    • Create two implementations of these two interfaces (so total 4
    classes) for Chocolate and Strawberry flavors.
    • Use Dependency injection to inject the Frosting and Syrup
    dependencies into CakeBaker and also to call the bakeCake
    function of the CakeBaker class.
